## Installing
Before you install check if you have all dependencies above, once you have run:

npm install

npm init

The npm init command will create a basic package.json file.


now you have a fresh and complete web project to start from scratch

## Grunt
we decided use grunt for organize and help us in repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc.


## Grunt Sass
we have 2 css files compiled by grunt sass:

.dev.css  for development so you can see the line and the name of file for debug.

.dist.css  for distribution when you finish your App.
